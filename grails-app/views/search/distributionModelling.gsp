        <h2>Background information to online maps as available on FishMap, the ALA website and the AODN Portal</h2>

        <p>CSIRO Marine
        and Atmospheric Research, Australia (CMAR) has used a technique for 2-dimensional
        analysis (distance around Australia's coast plus minimum-maximum depth range),
        translatable to geographic maps via a gridded bathymetry. These have been
        refined since the initial work which led to the Interim Marine and Coastal
        Regionalisation of Australia Report (IMCRA, 1996), through additional studies such
        as the CSIRO South-East Marine Region (SEMR) study, 2001, the Validation of
        National Demersal Fish Datasets for the Regionalisation of the Australian
        Continental Slope and Outer Shelf (Last <em>et
        al</em>., 2005), and for the CERF Marine Biodiversity Hub report (Lyne <em>et al</em>., 2009).
        For an overview of
        methodology see Last <em>et al</em>. (2005).</p>

        <p>Distributional
            ranges represent the currently known limits of occurrence for many species in
            terms of distance and depth around the Australian coastline, and are based on
            the best validated evidence and expert knowledge.</p>

        <p>The most
        recent version of the mapping data was compiled in 2010-2012 by a team from
        CMAR funded jointly by the CSIRO Wealth from Oceans (WfO) Flagship and the
        Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). The team comprised Daniel Gledhill, Peter Last
        and William White, assisted by Tony Rees (Data Management and Data Publishing
        support) and John Pogonoski, Alastair Graham, Carlie Devine and Louise Conboy
        (Australian National Fish Collection). However, there has been significant
        contributions from participants in earlier parts of this work, including Alan
        Williams, Alison Phillips, Gordon Yearsley, Roger Scott, Spikey Riddoch, Suzanne Long and Vincent
        Lyne (CSIRO), Martin Gomon and Di Bray (Museum Victoria), Ken Graham (formerly NSW Fisheries), Barry
        Hutchins (Western Australian Museum), Jeff Johnson (Queensland Museum), John
        Paxton, Mark McGrouther and Doug Hoese (Australian Museum), Barry Russell and Helen Larson (NT Museum),
        Tomio Iwamoto (California Academy of Sciences), Kunio Amaoka (Hokkaido University), Lee Belbin
        (formerly Australian Antarctic Division), and Patricia Kailola and Rudie Kuiter (consultants).</p>
